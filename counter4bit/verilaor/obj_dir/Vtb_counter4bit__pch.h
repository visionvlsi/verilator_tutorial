// DESCRIPTION: Verilator output: Precompiled header

// Internal details; most user sources do not need this header,
// unless using verilator public meta comments.
// Suggest use Vtb_counter4bit.h instead.

// GCC and Clang only will precompile headers (PCH) for the first header.
// So, make sure this is the one and only PCH.
// If multiple module's includes are needed, use individual includes.
